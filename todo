Bugs
====

autoConfigSize: height seems to be read before rendering complete -
                button text size bigger moved it down more.

Wonky accordion. :-)


QUnit patches:
      Only show diff if there is a difference!
      Option to print arb. data.
      Tap plan output.
      Option to suppress unwanted data dump.
      Catch errors in test - don't just let the whole thing die.

      Do something reasonable when stylesheet is not loaded. I found nothing happened and took
      ages to track down the bug.

Usability study notes
---------------------
Make slide action more obvious - arrow on slider, like bidirectional unlock?
Restrict slider end movement or at least add sufficient margin to allow for it
Attempted to drag resize grid.
Explain generation colours, possibly rename. Generation could mean
child is next colour, parent stays same.
Add a reference point / cursor?

Turn into a game.

Bugs
====
Resume draw on mouse in after a mouse out while drawing.

autoConfigSize: height seems to be read before rendering complete -
                button text size bigger moved it down more.

QUnit patches:
      Only show diff if there is a difference!
      Option to print arb. data.
      Tap plan output.
      Option to suppress unwanted data dump.
      Catch errors in test - don't just let the whole thing die.

      Do something reasonable when stylesheet is not loaded. I found nothing happened and took
      ages to track down the bug.

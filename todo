Usability study notes
---------------------
Label sliders
Make slide action more obvious - arrow on slider, like bidirectional unlock?
Remove min highlight on slider.
Restrict slider end movement or at least add sufficient margin to allow for it
Relabel / explain update speed.
Attempted to drag resize grid.
Explain generation colours, possibly rename. Generation could mean
child is next colour, parent stays same.
Add a reference point / cursor?

Turn into a game.



Get working on iOS again
    - Sizing for iPod: Dynamically size settings dialog.
Rename tick to step?
Bigger settings link, possibly button.
Bigger close button.
Bigger checkbox.

Productify for release
Save Config
Save state between reloads
Import / export grids
Pattern Library
Zoom (use pinch action)
Random initilisation
WebWorkers
Rules
Statistics - e.g. population graph over time


Bugs
====

autoConfigSize: height seems to be read before rendering complete -
                button text size bigger moved it down more.

Wonky accordion. :-)

Clicking off right side of grid tries to toggle null cells.

QUnit patches:
      Only show diff if there is a difference!
      Option to print arb. data.
      Tap plan output.
      Option to suppress unwanted data dump.
      Catch errors in test - don't just let the whole thing die.

      Do something reasonable when stylesheet is not loaded. I found nothing happened and took
      ages to track down the bug.
